                    Band's Story
                </div>

                <div class="text-story">
                    <p>Forming in the United States in 1985, Guns N’Roses is one of the main rock bands in the world. Together, Axl Rose, Slash, Richard Fortus, Duff McKagan, Frank Ferrerter, Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese have sold more than 100 million clubs
                        over the years.</p>
                    <p>The group was formed by members of Hollywood Rose, Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin and of LA Guns, Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Robbie Gardner. From this merger came the name Guns N’Roses - a combination of two of the group members' names.
                        A few weeks later, bassist Ole Beich was replaced by Duff McKagan while the lack of Tracii Guns at rehearsals led to his replacement by Slash.</p>
                    <p>After Rob Gardner left, Steven Adler took over the drums and so this was the group's first stable formation until the “Hell Tour”. The stage debut took place on June 6, 1986, at the Troubador, in Hollywood, for around 150 people.</p>
                    <P>After a few months, Guns N’Roses released one of the main albums of their career: Appetite for Destruction. This was the first debut album by a hard rock band to reach #1 on the charts and was also the best-selling debut album in music
                        history, with nearly 18 million copies sold in the United States alone. Around this time, the group began opening shows for icons such as Iron Maiden and the Rolling Stones.</P>
                    <p>G N'R Lies hit stores the following year, in 1988. Comprised of just four new compositions and four recordings from the EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, the album climbed the charts and joined Appetite for Destruction, which continues
                        to sell more and more.</p>
                    <p>The 90's started a frenzy for musicians with the resignation of Steven Adler, being replaced by Matt Sorum, who played in The Cult. A few months earlier, keyboardist Dizzy Reed had become the sixth member of the group.</p>
                    <p>In January 1991, they were present at Rock in Rio 2, at the Maracanã stadium, in Rio de Janeiro, and played to their largest audience so far: 140 thousand people on January 20th and 120 thousand on January 23rd. In May of the same
                        year, they started the world tour of the albums Use Your Illusion, starting in the city of East Troy, in the United States - the series of shows lasted 26 months, with 192 concerts in 32 countries.</p>
                    <p>Guns N' Roses have released seven studio albums, two EPs, one live album and three music DVDs throughout their career. The band's most recent album is Chinese Democracy, released in 2008 and the first work with new tracks since 1993's
                        The Spaghetti Incident?</p>
                    <p>Among the most successful songs are "Welcome to the Jungle", "Paradise City", "Don't Cry", "Sweet Child o' Mine", "Patience", "November Rain" which reached the top 10 of the Billboard. In its new phase, the songs "Chinese Democracy",
                        "Street of Dreams" and "Better", singles from the Chinese Democracy album, stand out.</p>
                    <p>The band has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, with about 43 million in the United States alone.</p>
                    <p>The band's musical style, stage presence and bad boy image contributed to the group's success during a new era of hard rock domination in the late 1980s and early 1990s. records, video charts and radio, Guns N' Roses offered a more
                        traditional rock sound, and won over many fans, impressed by their thrilling authenticity.</p>
                    <p>The band enjoyed great worldwide success between 1988 and 1993, but due to personality conflicts between the group members led to the end of the original lineup. Currently, Axl Rose and Dizzy Reed are the only original members in the
                        Guns N' Roses lineup, having been vocalist since 1985 and keyboardist since 1990, respectively.</p>
